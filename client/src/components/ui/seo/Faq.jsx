                SEO stands for “search engine optimization.” It's a marketing
                strategy that businesses use to improve their visibility and
                ranking in search engine results pages (SERPs). When someone
                makes a search using a keyword or phrase that's relevant to your
                business, you want your mobile and desktop web pages to appear
                as close to the top of the results list as possible. Some
                studies have shown that the vast majority of Internet users only
                click on results that appear on the first page of SERPs. So if
                you're not ranking in the top few results, you could be missing
                out on a lot of potential customers. To improve your ranking,
                businesses use on-page SEO strategies like keyword research and
                backlinking. Keyword research involves finding the right
                keywords and phrases that people are searching for when they're
                looking for businesses like yours. Once you've identified these
                keywords, you can incorporate them into your website copywriting
                across both desktop and mobile, to help boost your ranking. You
                can also perform off-page SEO, which might involve promoting
                your online presence via social media or other digital
                platforms. Backlinking is the process of getting other websites
                to link to your website. This helps improve your ranking because
                it signals to Google and Bing that your website is popular and
                relevant, which will lead to a positive feedback loop. The more
                traffic you can drive to your website, the higher your ranking
                will eventually be.

                The cost of SEO services vary depending on the needs of your
                business and the size of your budget. But in general, SEO is a
                relatively affordable marketing strategy, especially when you
                compare it to other marketing channels like pay-per-click (PPC)
                advertising. And unlike PPC, SEO is an “inbound” marketing
                strategy, which means it can lead to more customers without
                having to pay for each click. At NinjaPromo, we offer a range of
                professional SEO-related services to fit any budget. We'll work
                with you to assess your needs and develop a customized plan that
                fits within your available spend. Whether you're looking for a
                comprehensive approach or just need help with specific tasks
                like keyword research or backlinks, we can tailor a solution
                that will lead to results.

                The type of SEO you need depends on your company goals and the
                current state of your website. If you're just getting started
                with SEO, you may need a comprehensive approach that covers
                everything from keyword research to on-page optimization to link
                building. But if you've been doing SEO for a while and just need
                help with specific tasks, you may only require one specialized
                service. The best way to determine which type of SEO service is
                right for you is to consult with an experienced SEO company. At
                NinjaPromo, our team has been helping businesses with their SEO
                for over 5 years combined. We can also perform a website audit
                to assess your current positioning and make recommendations on
                which type of SEO services would be most beneficial for you.
